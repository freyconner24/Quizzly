# Quizzly App

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

You must run this command every time you change a React file: `browserify -t [ babelify --presets [ react ] ] components/app.js -o assets/js/bundle.js`

I recommend having 2 terminal windows open.  In one window you run the compile line above and in the other window you run the server with `sails lift`
